            * By means of a quick intro...
            * Slightly dorky picture...!
            * Programmer: use that in a fairly broad sense and maybe in a slightly ironic way
            as some find it a derogatory simplication of a specific field of development.
            Saying that: primarily develop for the web.

          <section data-background="lib/img/blogging.jpg">
            <h2 class="highlight">"Just a blogging platform"</h2>
            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						  * Simply, Ghost is an application which allows you to write and publish
              your own blog.
              * It's just a blogging platform.
              * Powerful mantra to have as a guilding principal,
              particularly in an area of software that is rife
              with complexity and hard-to-use/hard-to-understand interfaces and systems.
              * It's JUST a blogging platform. It does nothing else.
              Puts nothing between you as the publisher and your content.

            <h3>Free. Open-source. Simple to use.</h3>
            <h3 class="fragment highlight">Media publication for the masses.</h3>
            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              * It's completely free. You pay nothing to use the application.
              * It's open-source. The code is in a public repo on Github and
              downloadable from their site.
              * It's simple to use. Ghost hosts a very sleek, minimal interface
              that allows you to focus on your content without distraction. But more
              than that, it's very easy to set up. Spend less time making your blog work
              and more time blogging.
              * In their own words, it's "media publication for the masses."

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              * To understand more about what Ghost is and where it fits into the
              bigger picture of blogging, it'd serve us well to look at where it came
              from and why. So: look at the story behind Ghost, or...the Ghost story

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              * Rather appropriately, it all started with a blog post
              * Nov 2012 - John O'Nolan wrote a blog post about his idea of an ideal blogging
              platform: comprised mostly of a very minimal UI, nothing gets in the way of the
              publisher and their writing
              * The underlying purpose of the post: see whether bloggers were running into
              same frustrations and difficulties as he was

              * Met with positive feedback
              * Set about building a WP plugin that would completely replace
              the WP admin section
              * Ambitious but a worthwhile goal. The first time I tried to set up
               a WP blog, knowing nothing about WP, and opened up the admin area for the
              first time...

              same technological and philsophical brick walls that stem from operating
              within and developing for an existing platform
              * So...they decided to build their own app
              * A prototype was finished and it went up on Kickstarter

              use a platform like Node for Ghost.
              * The plugin they had begun to build for WP was largely a client-side JS
              app - moving that to the server was a natural progression
              * But also wanted Ghost to be positioned as part of a vibrant open-source

              * Makes development of themes a very clean and easy process -
              include bits of Handlebars where needed
              * Also means there's a much lower bar of entry to customisation - it's just
              HTML and CSS. No PHP involved.

              * For the DB: wanted to support SQL first and foremost, primarily SQLite
              * The reason for this is so that they could minimise the amount of setup needed
              to get going with Ghost - you can run `npm install ghost && npm start` and
              you're good to go; again, nothing between a writer and their content

            $80 a month for 30 blogs
            * There will be a cap on number of view per plan
            * BUT a way of looking at it is that the hosted plans will be the main
            source of funding for Ghost. It's a way of contributing to the project.
